AI-Powered Medical Chatbot
This repository contains the code for an AI-powered medical chatbot built using a combination of BERT for sequence classification and Groq API for medical queries. The chatbot is capable of providing medical-related responses based on user input or indicating when a question is outside the scope of medical knowledge.

Features
Medical Chatbot: Answers user queries related to diseases, symptoms, or prevention.
BERT Model: Uses a pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification to match user input with predefined medical questions.
Groq API Integration: Uses Groq's API to refine and validate responses by leveraging an advanced language model.
Gradio Interface: A user-friendly web interface to interact with the chatbot.
Requirements
To run this chatbot, you'll need to set up a Python environment and install the following dependencies:

Python 3.10+
Google Colab (if running in the cloud)
transformers (for loading pre-trained models)
torch (for tensor computations)
nltk (for natural language processing)
gradio (for creating the interactive web interface)
groq (for interfacing with Groq's API)
Installation
1. Set up the environment
To set up the environment, you can follow the instructions below. If you're using Google Colab, these steps should already be configured.

bash
# Update and install python3-venv package
!apt-get update
!apt-get install python3.10-venv -y

# Create and activate a virtual environment
!python3 -m venv chatbot_env
!source chatbot_env/bin/activate

# Install necessary libraries
!pip install transformers torch nltk gradio groq
2. Clone this repository
You can clone this repository to your local machine or access it directly from Google Colab.

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-chatbot.git
3. Mount Google Drive (Optional)
If you wish to store your data or models on Google Drive, mount your Google Drive by running the following code in Colab:

python

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
4. Dataset
The chatbot uses a JSON file containing user intents (questions) and responses. This file can be placed on Google Drive or a local directory. Example structure:

json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "patterns": ["What are the symptoms of flu?", "How do I know if I have flu?"],
      "responses": ["Flu symptoms include fever, chills, body aches, and fatigue."]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
5. Run the chatbot
You can run the chatbot by simply executing the script in your Python environment or Google Colab. If you're using Gradio, the chatbot will launch an interactive web interface.

python
# Launch the Gradio interface
interface.launch()
This will create a web interface where users can type in their queries and get responses from the chatbot.

How it Works
Dataset: The chatbot is trained with a JSON dataset containing medical queries and responses.
Model: The chatbot uses a pre-trained BERT model (bert-base-uncased) for sequence classification. It computes question embeddings and matches the user input to the most similar question.
Groq API: Once the initial response is generated, the Groq API is used to validate and refine the response, ensuring that it is medically relevant.
Gradio Interface: A simple web interface powered by Gradio allows users to interact with the chatbot in real-time.
Usage
Input
Users can input a medical query such as:

"What are the symptoms of COVID-19?"
"How do I prevent the flu?"
"What is hypertension?"
Output
The chatbot will provide a response based on the available dataset or indicate if the query is outside the scope of medical knowledge.

Example output:

makefile
Assistant: Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.

Additional Notes
Groq API: Ensure you have an API key for the Groq service. You can replace the API key in the code if necessary.
Model Selection: You can experiment with other models from Hugging Face for better results, especially if you're focusing on a different domain.
